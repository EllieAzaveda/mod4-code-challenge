### Description
This project was a 6-8 hour time-boxed code challenge. We were required to use the NY Times Top Stories API as well as include the following: 
- A list of articles
- A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
- Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

### Reflection

#### Evolution of the Project 
This code challenge was limited to 6-8 hours total. I spent the first hour making wireframes, a data flowchart, and a project board including user stories that follow the requirements of the assignment. Then I started coding! I started with all of the base components and finalized all of the required functionality. Once this was finished, I fixed a few bugs and added styling. During the last hour, I added a "Sections" display with more articles organized by sections/topics. Later, I would love to incorporate a saving feature with persistence (localStorage).

#### Wins 
I completed my Minimum Viable Product goals within the timeboxed time! The app is also fully styled, is responsive, and is fully accessible (100% Lighthouse audit score).

#### Challenges
I attempted to start building out "Sections" displays, but unfortunately ran into some funky logic. It wasn’t as easy as I expected, but I was able to come back to it and get it completed. Still, this was surprisngly challenging. I also struggled to prioritize when I had very limited time and _unlimited_ options!
